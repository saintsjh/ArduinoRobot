This code controls an Arduino-based robot with an ultrasonic sensor and a servo motor. It continuously measures the distance to objects in front of it using the ultrasonic sensor. Based on the measured distance, the robot decides whether to move forward, stop, or back up. The servo motor likely controls a sensor or camera, sweeping it back and forth. The robot's movement is controlled by four pins (IN1-IN4) which are set in different combinations to achieve various motions like moving forward, backward, or turning.
